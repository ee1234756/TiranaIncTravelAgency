# TiranaInc. Travel Agency

**_Project overview_**<br/>
    **“Tirana Inc. Travel Agency”** is a website designed and built for this course using client-side and server-side markup and scripting; CSS, HTML, JAVASCRIPT and PHP with a particular focus on PHP.

**_Purpose and scope of this specification_**<br/>
    The purpose of this website is to offer a company, that is, Tirana Inc.Travel Agency, a website where users can view information regarding the agency, signup and login to book packages that it offers, as well as other features. It also includes a different login page where the admin could login using credentials on the database and access client data as well as manage packages, agents and other functionalities. It offers multi-user access.

**_CONTEXT_**<br/>
    It has a simple, and yet elegant front-end design using front-end frameworks, that is bootstrap and jquery, to facilitate the working process but also manage features like mobile view, animation etc. which alter the overall user experience. Although front-end frameworks are used and referenced on the website folder, tweaks and further designs are also implemented to apply changes according to the vision I had crafted upon planning this project. It is true that this web-site is fully functional for the thought functionalities, but it is worth mentioning that because of the time frame of this project limit, further changes can be made and other features could be implemented to make it more advanced. That being said, the website could be used for a travel agency and it fully implements the pre-planned functional requirements.
